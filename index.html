                Hello, my name is Cora Renee Kirkpatrick
                <br>
                I've put together this Portfolio website to showcase my skills as a web developer and an audio producer.
                <br>
                I have a passion for both subjects and have put myself through school for audio production, and have self taught myself web development languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                <br>
                I hope that you enjoy the work that you're about to see. There was a lot of hard work and dedication involved in both the audio and the website.
